- Implement the `SolverAdapter` trait with `async-trait` for all adapters.
- Use `reqwest::Client` for HTTP requests to solver endpoints.
- Apply per-solver timeouts (1000â€“3000 ms) using `tokio::time::timeout`.
- Normalize solver responses into a common `Quote` struct with `serde_json::Value` for flexibility.
- Handle errors gracefully, returning `Result<_, Error>` for all adapter methods.
- Example implementation: `@src/adapters/oif.rs`.
- Methods to implement: `get_quote` and `submit_intent`.
- Ensure adapters are registered with a unique `adapter_id` in the storage layer.
